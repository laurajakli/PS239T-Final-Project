By offering Americans an honorable, principled choice in this election, and being joined by thousands of supporters and volunteers to make a credible third party ticket part of the national conversation, we took significant steps toward reshaping the political landscape. For that, I am both proud and grateful.This campaign was not about Bill Weld and me. It was not even about 2016. It was about a small government, greater freedom movement that I am confident will take hold and grow well beyond this election. It was about showing millennials, young people and all Americans that they do not have to blindly accept a two party duopoly. We have hopefully set the stage for that movement to flourish and have real success at the polls. This is a great nation filled with great people. Bill Weld and I are honored to have provided a voice for millions of those great people, and deeply grateful to all those who made this historic effort possible. Today is a day to wish the President-elect our best wishes, and a sincere hope that, together, we can get about the business of addressing the challenges this great nation faces.",,status,,11/9/16 11:57,70554,4122,9811,61937,6857,11,59,1468,222,2016-11-09

With the possible exception of partisans on the extremes, I also suspect they were disappointed.Americans don't want their children and grandchildren to inherit a $20 trillion debt, and they didn't hear anything [last night] that will keep that from happening. Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump are afraid to tell the truth about spending. It's easier to just promise more of it and send the next generation the tab.Americans believe in the Constitution and the protections it's supposed to provide. Mr. Trump appears willing to 'frisk' those protections away if they get in the way of his version of fixing things. There was a time when Republicans believed in free trade and creating jobs through growth, not protectionism. What happened to that?Our military men and women and their families deserve leadership they can trust to not send them into harm's way to intervene in conflicts they can't possibly resolve and which may or may not have a clear U.S. interest. They didn't get any reassurance [last night]. Americans want our military to protect us, not put their lives on the line to chase someone's agenda.We deserve better, but what we saw [last night] was a promise that the bickering, the pandering and the polarization will continue. America is already great. It's great leaders we are lacking, and I don't think we found them on the stage [last night].Maybe that's why Google searches for Gary Johnson are off the charts right now.-Gov.

After all, the Commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally-televised presidential debates voters will see. At the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn't want any third party intrusions into their shows.The only time a third candidate has been allowed on the stage was 1992, when both parties wanted him on the stage for their own purposes. It should be noted that, when Perot was allowed on the stage, polls showed his support to be in single digits, below where Johnson and Weld are currently polling.The CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys 'only' 9 or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.Americans are tired of rigged systems, and the monopoly on debates created by the CPD is a prime and skillfully executed example.Bill Weld and I will continue to fight to provide a voice and an alternative for  independents, disenfranchised Republicans and Democrats, Millennials and others who aren't satisfied with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as their options.It is unfortunate that the CPD doesn't believe such a voice should be heard.

And, ignoring the fact that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than any other group, he turned up the volume on the 'blame immigrants first' language that has derailed real immigration reform for more than decade.As for his tripled ICE deportation agents, what are they going to do?

Weld and I issued the following statement this morning regarding the Dallas police shootings: ""Our thoughts are with the families and colleagues of the Dallas police officers who were so brutally murdered. The apparently calculated and cold-blooded shooting of those who were simply trying to ensure the peaceful exercise of citizens' rights to protest is both despicable and unacceptable in our society.Violence and murder are not how we deal with problems in America. But to the extent that they are symptoms of the real issues of injustices suffered by minorities and mistrust of authorities, we cannot hide from those issues. All Americans, including those in law enforcement, deserve leadership that will restore public faith and begin the process of healing the divide between those in authority and those who are subject to that authority, regardless of race, ethnicity and economic status.We have real issues in this country with regard to the relationship between law enforcement and our communities -- and those issues must be dealt with calmly and cooperatively. As we go about that effort, we must all join in rejecting the kind of cowardly and tragic atrocity that has occurred in Dallas.As a nation, we have wounds to bind.""",,status,,7/8/16 13:12,15510,403,5466,14364,717,3,2,418,6,2016-07-08

165297924363_10153132959439364,"Friends,One week ago today, the Libertarian Party honored Governor Bill Weld and me with its nominations for President and Vice-President of the United States. We both are genuinely honored -- and grateful.We understand that, as the Party's nominees in this potentially historic election, we have a deep obligation to all those who have worked so hard for so long to put the Libertarian Party in a position to change America. Whether you were in Orlando for the nominating convention or watching from afar, you know that the nomination battles were, at times, contentious. That is as it should be. From the day I announced my candidacy, I made clear my intention to earn the nomination. Regardless of the media attention and speculation that abounded, I never overlooked the simple fact that my first task was to gain your confidence.Now, it is time to put the nomination battles behind us. It is a great indication of the opportunity we face that there were a number of energetic, aggressive candidates asking for your support. I respect those candidates and the campaigns they mounted. None of us is perfect, and the nomination battles were great preparation for the general election battles that lie ahead.Ours is a Party that is relatively small in numbers, but with ideas that appeal to many. We do not have the luxury of letting minor differences get in the way of joining together to present the American people with a small government, greater freedom alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. And as we present our ideas on the national level, the benefits will be great for candidates for offices at all levels -- whether they be running for Congress or City Council.This is our time. Let us unite, put our differences aside, and get to work reaching out to the tens of millions of Americans who, as I often say, are Libertarian, but just don't know it yet.I look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail, and to working with you to take advantage of the amazing opportunities 2016 presents.Thank you for your hard work on behalf of Liberty -- and for your friendship.Gov.

165297924363_10153109454754364,"A Message from Gov. Gary Johnson for Libertarian DelegatesFriends, With less than a week until the LIbertarian National Convention gets underway, I want to take a moment to share some thoughts -- and to ask for your vote.You know me. I first joined the Libertarian Party in 1993. For the past five years, I've been traveling to all corners of the nation, attending as many Libertarian gatherings as I can, taking the principles of Liberty to the airwaves, and spending hundreds of hours listening to you and discussing the path forward to solidifying the Libertarian Party as the real alternative to the Republicans and Democrats.Finally, our work is paying off. Building on the work of those who have gone before us, we have put the Libertarian Party in the national conversation. Just last week, Fox News did three separate stories in one day about the role the Libertarian Party will potentially play in 2016. It's safe to say that has never happened before, and I'm grateful to be a part of making that happen.We probably haven't agreed about everything. In fact, I don't know anyone who agrees with me 100% of the time. But we DO agree on the fundamental idea that government should be small, and Liberty should be great. We agree that the force of government must not be used to take our freedoms from us, and we agree that the Libertarian Party best represents our shared vision of a government that protects Liberty as the true American value.Together, in 2012, we made history by garnering more votes for a Libertarian presidential candidate than ever before. But that is nothing compared to our opportunity in 2016. The Republicans and Democrats have handed us what is undoubtedly the greatest opportunity ever to compete on an equal footing with the two ""major"" parties. The pollsters see it. The media sees it, and most important, millions of Americans see it.The spotlight is on us -- and we have to perform.With the nominating convention upon us, I want to be sure your questions are answered and your concerns addressed. I hope we have an opportunity to visit personally in Orlando, but in the meantime, I want to address a few concerns that have been raised by some.In a nationally-televised debate among three of the Libertarian candidates for President (A debate that should, by the way, have been more inclusive of all the candidates.), a highly unlikely hypothetical question was raised about whether a Jewish baker has the right to refuse to serve a Nazi sympathizer asking for a ""Nazi cake"". I responded to that question in the legal context of whether a public business has the right to refuse to serve a member of the public, as distasteful as it might be. The simple answer to that question is, whether all like it or not, U.S. law has recognized the principle of public accommodation for more than 100 years: The principle that, when a business opens its doors to the public, that business enters into an implied contract to serve ALL of the public. Further, when that business voluntarily opens its doors, the owners voluntarily agree to adhere to applicable laws and regulations -- whether they like those laws or not.To be clear, anti-discrimination laws do not, and cannot, abridge fundamental First Amendment rights. I know of no one who reasonably disagrees. In the highly unlikely event that a Nazi would demand that a Jewish baker decorate a cake with a Nazi symbol, the courts, common sense, and common decency -- not to mention the First Amendment -- all combine to protect that baker from having to do so. It's not an issue, except when distorted for purposes of gotcha politics.Does a public bakery have to sell a cake to a Nazi? Probably so. Does that bakery have to draw a swastika on it? Absolutely not. And that's the way it should be. Of course, we all know that this conversation is really ""code"" for the current, and far more real, conversation about society's treatment of LGBT individuals. I have even heard some talk of a ""right to discriminate"". And of course, we have states and municipalities today trying to create a real right to discriminate against the LGBT community on religious grounds -- the same kinds of ""religious"" grounds that were used to defend racial segregation, forbid interracial marriages and, yes, defend discrimination against Jews by businesses. That is not a slope Libertarians want to go down. Once again, my belief that discrimination on the basis of religion should not be allowed has been distorted by some to suggest that a legitimate church or its clergy should be ""forced"" to perform a same-sex marriage. That is absurd. The various ballot initiatives I supported across the country to repeal bans on same-sex marriage all had one provision in common: A specific provision making clear that no religious organization, priest or pastor could be required to perform any rite contrary to that organization's or individual's faith. That protection was supported almost universally by the LGBT community -- even though most legal scholars agreed that such a protection already exists in the Constitution. We just wanted to leave no doubt. I was the first major candidate in the 2012 presidential campaign to call for full marriage equality, and Libertarians have long stood for equal treatment under the law for all Americans. As your candidate for President, I will not tarnish that record.Another concern some have raised, with the help of some misleading blog reports, relates to the finances of the 2012 campaign. As you know, the Federal Election Commission is a government agency. Dealing with them is not unlike dealing with the IRS. It can take years and far too much money to resolve issues. Due to the nature of FEC reporting, our 2012 campaign reports continue to show a substantial ""debt"". That is in no way unusual. Most major national campaigns have the same reporting issue. The actual debts listed by the FEC have, in reality, been resolved and the resolution has been submitted to the FEC for approval -- months ago. Our attorneys continue to work with the FEC to gain acceptance of our submissions, and we are confident they will ultimately do so. This is a tedious and burdensome process that plagues virtually all major campaigns, and says more about the nature of government regulation than it does about our finances.The key fact for you, as a Delegate, to know is that NO funds being raised for the 2016 campaign will be used to reduce the 2012 debts shown on our campaign disclosure reports.I hope this information is helpful, and encourage you to bring any additional questions or concerns to me directly at the convention. As Libertarians, we have an opportunity in this election to truly make history. It is important that we do it right. National polls are already showing me to be in double digits against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton -- and we haven't really gotten started yet.But understand this: Despite all the media attention, polls and excitement, I know that my first task is to earn your vote at the nominating convention in Orlando next weekend. And I am dedicated to that task.We have taken amazing strides -- together -- to put the Libertarian Party on the national stage as a serious, credible alternative to the Republicans and Democrats. Next weekend, I am asking you to allow me the honor of taking even greater strides, with your help and support. We have known one another since the days when we were fighting for even the slightest recognition, and I have not forgotten that you were doing the hard work even before it became fashionable, as was I.I look forward to seeing you in Orlando. Our campaign will be hosting a social event Friday evening. Please join us. Likewise, we will have an ""office"" set up in Salon I of the convention hotel, and I urge you to stop by. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you!Gov. Gary Johnson",,status,,5/22/16 20:17,5836,883,1847,5504,312,7,11,0,2,2016-05-22

On the Democrat side, it is difficult to imagine voters who are energized for Bernie Sanders taking that enthusiasm to Hillary Clinton.""Thanks to the realities of ballot access at this late date, there will be only one third-party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states in November. That candidate will be the Libertarian nominee. ""I would submit that the true 'mainstream' in American politics today, especially among the critical 80 million millennials who comprise the largest voter segment in U.S. history, adheres to the simple idea that government is too big, costs too much, and has in fact become a corrupt threat to individual freedom. ""Both the Republican and Democratic parties have fumbled around and constructed nomination processes that make it virtually impossible for a candidate reflecting that 'mainstream' to emerge.
