240944029279128_1380664685307051,"One of our election integrity advisors Bob Fitrakis co-wrote this article:""Hillary Clinton's margin of victory in the 2016 vote count continues to climb, at this point well over a million. But her impending defeat in the Electoral College comes with familiar signs that the election was stripped and flipped.These indicators include the realities of pre- and post-election polling; the massive stripping of primarily black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters from computer generated registration rolls mostly maintained by private partisan companies; unverifiable ""black box"" electronic voting machines and central tabulators, also mostly manufactured and maintained by private corporations, and much more.Were this election held in any other country, the US State Department and independent monitors from around the world would denounce it as a fraud, and contemplate international intervention. The Electoral CollegeMuch is finally being said about the Electoral College, with new popular demands for its abolition. Clinton is about to become the sixth presidential candidate to win a traditional majority but lose the presidency. It also happened in 1800, 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000. Nearly 15% of our 45 presidents have been ""selected"" with the denial of the public will through an institution established in large part to enhance the power of slaveowners.In February, 2013, at progressive.org, we joined the multitudes throughout our history in calling for the EC's abolition:It will take a Constitutional Amendment, and a hell of a lot of work, to abolish this corrupt anachronism. But unless we want to see an endless succession of George W. Bushes in the White House, something better be done -- and quick.The consequences of inaction are all too clear.Computerized Jim Crow Stripping of Voter Registration RollsUS history has been defined throughout by a divide-and-conquer strategy of racial manipulation. As we outline in our new Strip & Flip Death of American Democracy (freepress.org / solartopia.org): chattel slavery, the Constitution's ""three-fifths bonus,"" Jim Crow segregation, third world imperial conquest and the Drug War have all played a role in denying African-American/Hispanic/Asian-American citizens their right to vote. From the foundation of the Republic, this disenfranchisement has defined the balance of power.In recent years, the disenfranchisement has been most importantly done by the Republican Party, and by computer. As investigative reporter Greg Palast has shown in his book/movie The Best Democracy Money Can Buy (www.gregpalast.com) in 2000 Florida Governor Jeb Bush used a program called ChoicePoint to strip more than 90,000 predominantly black and Hispanic citizens from the voter registration rolls in an election decided by 537 votes. The pretext was alleged felony convictions. The selection was ""won"" by Bush's brother George W although a full recount (which was stopped by the US Supreme Court by one vote) would have given Al Gore the majority in Florida, and in the Electoral College.As we have reported from Columbus, in 2004 more than 300,000 predominantly urban citizens were stripped from the voter registration rolls in an election the GOP won by 118,775. A quarter of all voters in heavily Democratic Cleveland were de-registered. Ohio's ill-got electoral votes gave George W. Bush a second term. This became the only time in US history an entire state's Electoral College delegation was challenged on the floor of the US Congress.This year, Palast has reported that a new program called Crosscheck has been used by some 30 GOP Secretaries of State to strip more than 1.1 million predominantly black, Hispanic, Islamic and Asian-American citizens from the voter rolls.Originating with far-right Republican Kris Kobach, Kansas's Secretary of State, Crosscheck eliminated more than enough minority voters in at least three swing states to flip the entire presidential election.Palast has reported Ohio's GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted also used Crosscheck to eliminate some 497,000 mostly black, Latino and African-American citizens from the voter rolls in Ohio, falsely accusing them of registering in more than one state. Such eliminations went on throughout the US and may have involved more than a million legitimate voters.According to Reuters, over the past five years Husted himself stripped some two million citizens from the voter rolls in Ohio without Crosscheck, with Democratic areas twice as likely to be striped as Republicans. Reuters points out that the neighborhoods that most heavily backed President Obama lost the most voters.The mass disenfranchisement also impacted races for the US Senate. At least four Democrats would likely have won seats (in Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Missouri) that they officially lost (www.tdmsresearch.com. Similar results are evident from 2014 Senate races in North Carolina, Colorado and Alaska. Thus in the past two years, mass disenfranchisement and computerized vote stripping may well have stripped seven Upper House seats from the Democrats to the GOP.Thus the electronic race-based stripping of voter rolls in the GOP's favor has probably on its own taken to the far right the presidency, control of the US Senate and ultimately the US Supreme Court.It should be noted that out of disgust with Donald Trump, the GOP multi-billionaire Koch Brothers shifted much of their massive financial weight from the presidential race to Congressional and other ""down-ballot contests,"" where these key Senate seats and others in the US House and state governments were almost certainly impacted.Traditional Jim Crow Stripping of Voter Registration RollsAlongside computerized techniques, the Republicans have effectively deployed still more traditional Jim Crow tactics to strip black/Hispanic/Asian-American citizens of their ability to vote. In part these include: demands for photo ID, elimination of polling places, narrowing time frames in which citizens can vote, deliberate distribution of misinformation about voting requirements, non-counting of provisional ballots, failure to send out absentee ballots, intimidation and widespread confusion at polling places [Google voting map] and much more.In its 2013 Shelby County vs. Holder decision, the US Supreme Court gutted protections provided by the 1965 Voting Rights Act, opening the floodgates for Jim Crow abuse throughout the electoral system.Numerous reports indicate that citizens were often confronted with photo ID requirements even where they were voided by the courts. As in Ohio 2004, reports indicate many citizens were directed by official websites to polling places that did not actually exist.  This year Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted failed to distribute more than 1,050,000 absentee ballot applications to citizens entitled to them. On Election Day, media throughout the US reported the kinds of mass delays and confusion that defined the elections of 2000 and 2004.  Said the New York Times: ""Voters nationwide endured long waits in line, malfunctioning voting machines, ill-informed poll workers and a litany of lesser annoyances on Tuesday with scattered reports that some voters gave up trying to cast ballots.""David Becker, the Executive Director of the Center for Election Innovation, told the Times, ""There are scattered indications of machine breakdowns that are being addressed.""In an editorial the day after the election, the Times lamented that in North Carolina ""The state's Republican Party issued a news release boasting that cutbacks in early voting hours reduced black turnout by 8.5% below 2012 levels, even as the numbers of white early voters increased by 22.5%."" Fourteen states put in new voting restrictions including some states that were never under federal supervision like Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Throughout the US, voters with ""problems"" in their registration are routinely given provisional ballots, allegedly to be counted later. But the forms are often impossibly complex, with poll workers often failing to count them at the sight of a single minor error, such as writing below a line, omitting a middle initial, failing to include a birthday and much more. Ohio Secretary of State Husted won the right from the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to not count prevision ballots that contain a minor mistake. Thus tens of thousands of provisional ballots are thus routinely left uncounted, unbeknownst to the voters. More than 115,000 provisional and ""spoiled"" ballots from the Ohio 2004 election remain uncounted.Polling IndicatorsIn the lead-up to November 8, pre-election polls strongly indicated a Clinton victory. Post-Election exit polls showed her winning as well, most critically in the swing states whose Electoral College votes could give her the presidency.Exit polls are the accepted international standard for indications of election fraud and vote tampering. Eric Bjornlund and Glenn Cowan's 2011 pamphlet ""Vote Count Verification: a User's Guide for Funders, Implementers and Stakeholders."" Their work, done under the auspices of Democracy International for the US Agency for International Development (USAID), outlines how exit polling is used to ensure free and fair elections.It adds that ""U.S-funded organizations have sponsored exit polls as part of democracy assistance programs in Macedonia (2005), Afghanistan (2004), Ukraine (2004), Azerbaijan (2005), the West Bank and Gaza Strip (2005), Lebanon (2005), Kazakhstan (2005), Kenya (2005, 2007), and Bangladesh (2009), among other places.""In countries like Germany and Switzerland, which use hand-counted paper ballots, exit polls are accurate to a margin error of less than 1%.Here the 2016 exit polls were paid for by a major corporate media consortium, as has been standard practice for years. Here they are designed to reflect the actual vote count within a 2% margin of error nationally.But in the US, if exit polls don't agree with official vote counts, they are regularly ""adjusted"" to conform to official results, no matter how implausible. This makes fraudulent elections appear legitimate.During this year's Republican primaries, unadjusted exit polls confirmed official vote counts in all cases. In the Democratic primaries, unadjusted exit polls significantly varied from the official outcome in 12 of 26 primaries. All the errors went in Hillary Clinton's favor in her race against Bernie Sanders. This is a virtual statistical impossibility and suggests a rigged vote count.In the general election against Donald Trump, things went the other way. In 24 of 28 states, unadjusted exit polls also showed Clinton with vote counts significantly higher than the final official outcome. The likelihood of this happening in an election that is not rigged are in the realm of virtual statistical impossibility. In fact, based on the exit polls, the odds against such an unexplained ""Trump Shift"" are one in 13,110 presidential elections.For example, Ohio's exit polls showed Trump and Clinton in a dead heat â€“ 47 percent for Clinton to 47.1 for Trump. Officially, Trump won with 52.1 percent of the vote to Clinton's 43.5 percent. This unexplained and unexpected 8.5 percent shift for Trump is mathematically impossible. (see chart below)Given the prevalence of other Jim Crow tactics, it's likely the exit polls were impacted by non-white voters in all the key swing states who were given provisional ballots (or they voted electronically) leading them to believe their votes were being counted, even though they were not.In key Senate races in Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Missouri, exit polls also showed Democratic candidates winning by statistically significant margins, but then losing the official vote count. In 2014, Senate races in North Carolina, Colorado and Alaska ended with exit polls also showing Democratic Senate candidates winning the popular vote, while ultimately losing the official vote count. The odds against this happening in two consecutive elections that are not rigged are also astronomical. (see chart below)Electronic FlippingThe vast majority of the popular votes in this election nationwide were cast on either computerized touch-screen electronic machines, or on scantron ballots that are counted by computer. In neither case are there public monitoring capabilities or legal recourse for vote counts that are flipped. In 2016, as in all previous US elections at least since 2000, the electronic vote count remains anyone's guess. In states with a governor and Secretary of State from the same party, the final tally can be whatever they want it to be. Such techniques were used in Florida 2000 and Ohio 2004 to strip voter rolls and flip George W. Bush into the White House. More than 90,000 black/Hispanic voters were disenfranchised by Gov. Jeb Bush (George's brother) in a Florida election officially decided by 537 votes. More than 300,000 primarily black/Hispanic voters were stripped from voter rolls in an Ohio 2004 election officially decided by 118,775.In Florida's 2000 presidential election, in Volusia County 16,000 votes cast for Gore were electronically subtracted and 4,000 were added to Bush, giving him a leg up on the evening's vote count. This caused a Fox News commentator John Ellis (who was Bush's first cousin) to call the election for George W. Bush. In Ohio 2004, John Kerry was shown winning the election by 4.2%, more than 200,000 votes, at 12:20am. Then the electronic vote count ceased. At 2 a.m. a Bush lead began to emerge, somehow reaching 2.5%. The 6.7% flip is a virtual statistical impossibility. All of this was done by private contractors working for the company SmarTech, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The key information technology specialist in charge of the vote count was Michael Connell, an Akron-based associate of the Bush family, who was hired by the Ohio Secretary of state with a no-bid contract to supervise the state's official vote count. Connell later died in a mysterious plane crash after being deposed in federal court.The fact that electronic voting machines cannot be monitored was voted a Most Censored story in 2016 with a key interview appearing on Amy Goodman's DEMOCRACY NOW.Computer ""Black Box Voting"" specialist Bev Harris, who uncovered the electronic vote flipping in Florida 2000, has warned this year that a method of ""fractionated voting"" could have been easily used to manipulate electronic vote counts. The manipulation could be done by Secretaries of State in conjunction with partisan for-profit corporations in ways that are virtually impossible to detect, and simply not open to legal challenge. According to Harris, this ""fraction magic,"" used in county central tabulators, could have flipped hundreds of thousands of votes.In Ohio this year, a new generation of electronic vote scanning machines makes it possible to retrieve electronic images of ballots that have been cast on paper in the order that they were cast. These machines come with an audit log that would detect any illegitimate vote changes by central tabulators. But Secretary of State Husted opted to allow local election boards to leave both security functionsâ€”-the audit log and the image scannersâ€”turned off. Co-author Bob Fitrakis sued in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, to have the monitoring functions turned on. But Judge David Cain ruled on Election Day that the election officials need not turn on those security features.Throughout the US, including the swing states that will decide the presidential outcome in the Electoral College, and in those that have increased the GOP margin in the US Senate, the entire vote count remains an electronic mystery. Millions of dollars would be required to do meaningful recounts in states like Wisconsin, which may well have legitimately gone for Clinton and chosen a Democratic US Senator. Huge sums of money would be required to fund independent investigators to confirm who actually won these public offices as cast, recordedâ€”and possibly manipulatedâ€”on these electronic machines.So did the GOP strip and flip the 2016 election?Let's count the ways:There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton won America's popular vote by more than a million votes.That popular vote victory will be reversed in an Electoral College originally designed to enhance the power of slaveowners, now being used for the sixth time to deny the White House to the rightful winner.There is no doubt that more than enough black, Hispanic, Islamic and Asian-Americans were electronically stripped from the voter registration rolls by Crosscheck and other means to have given Clinton victories in those swing states that would have swung the Electoral College in her favor.There is no doubt additional Jim Crow tactics meant to further disenfranchise black/Hispanic/Asian-Americanâ€”such as stripping away voting times and precincts, denial of absentee ballots, non-counting of provisional ballots and much moreâ€”stripped Clinton of hundreds of thousands of additional legitimate votes.  There is no doubt exit polls showed her winning in more than enough states to have given her a victory in the Electoral College.There is no doubt that the election was largely conducted on electronic machines, and with electronically counted scantron ballots, that are completely beyond public accountability. These voting machines are run on secret corporate proprietary software to which the public is not allowed access.As in 2000 and 2004, the actual final vote count once again resides in black box machines controlled by GOP governors and Secretaries of State whose easy ability to hack and flip the official outcome cannot be monitored or brought to accountability. In at least one state (Ohio) the GOP took legal action to prevent the public from gaining potential access to the electronic vote countâ€_.and won!There is also no doubt that had this election been conducted as it was in virtually any other country, the civilized world would have denounced it as completely unreliable and almost certainly false. Had it been in our ""national interest"" to do so, American troops would have poured in to ""restore democracy"" after such an obviously rigged charade.Throughout the campaign GOP candidate Trump cleverly complained of a ""rigged election."" He continually warned of innumerable non-whites and Muslims voting multiple times for Hillary Clinton.Of course the opposite happened. Hundreds of thousands of non-white citizens were systematically denied their right to vote. Since even that wasn't enough to elect Donald Trump, the Electoral College will once again deny democracy. And thanks to the dark magic of electronic voting machines, we will never really know 2016's true vote count.Today's most tangible tragedy is what may soon unfold in this country.But the underlying nightmare is that this has been done before. That we've known about stripped and flipped elections for at least sixteen years. And that nothing has been done.If anything, due to the spread of electronic voting machines, our electoral system is more corrupt and less accountable than it was in 2000, when the GOP first stripped and flipped George W. Bush into the White House.We advocate universal automatic voter registration, transparent voter rolls, a four-day national holiday for voting, universal hand-counted paper ballots, abolition of the Electoral College, an end to gerrymandering, a ban on corporate money in politics.There's much more. But until we win those basics, democracy in America is an illusionâ€_.as is our chance to survive on this planet.""",Did the GOP Strip and Flip the 2016 Selection?,link,http://columbusfreepress.com/article/did-gop-strip-flip-2016-selection,11/28/16 17:00,1178,914,541,850,26,72,46,16,168,2016-11-28

Receipt of the filing from the Wisconsin Elections Commission was confirmed at 3:45pm.The filing fee for the recount request in Wisconsin is estimated to be approximately $1.1 million. After opening a fundraising drive on Wednesday, the campaign raised the needed funds for Wisconsin within a matter of hours. So far, over $5 million has been raised from over 110,000 donors with an average of $45 each. Total costs are expected to be approximately $7 million dollars.""We are standing up for an election system that we can trust; for voting systems that respect and encourage our vote, and make it possible for all of us to exercise our constitutional right to vote,"" said Jill Stein, former Green Party presidential candidate. ""We demand voting systems that are accurate, secure and accountable to the people. This is part of a larger commitment to election reform that our campaign and the Green Party has long stood for, which includes open debates, an end to voter ID laws and voter suppression, and ranked choice voting,"" Stein added.""The recount was not filed in order to change the election outcome, which is unlikely, nor to favor any one candidate. We are pursuing this recount to verify the integrity of the election result,"" said David Cobb, Stein/Baraka campaign manager. As the Green Party presidential candidate in 2004, Cobb led a recount effort in Ohio which led to election reforms in other states, including the banning of DRE touchscreen voting machines in California and a revamped voting system in New Mexico. The recount also helped to launch a nationwide movement for election integrity.The three states were recommended for scrutiny by election integrity experts and advocates because of the vulnerability of their voting systems and various indicators of concern - including unexplained high numbers of undervotes, the close results between the two candidates, and observed discrepancies between pre-election polling and the official result. Without meaningful machine audit procedures, a paper recount is the only sure way to verify an election result.The recount petition will be transmitted to the county canvassing boards in Wisconsin along with a formal request for an estimate of recount costs and a decision on recount methodology. The recount could begin by the second half of next week.The Stein/Baraka campaign is looking for volunteers to observe the recount in every county. To volunteer, interested individuals can contact the campaign at http://jill2016.com/RecountWI.",,video,https://www.facebook.com/drjillstein/videos/1376512802388906/,11/25/16 20:20,30887,27889,6654,19584,5303,197,672,147,4984,2016-11-25

It's ALL Indian land, but the land in question is Treaty land. Abrogations of the Ft. Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868 reduced the lands of the Great Sioux Nations in the last hundred+ years. However, the land surrounding and under Lake Oahe was stolen somewhat recently; in the 1960s. Here's some historical background:http://www.msnbc.com/interactives/geography-of-poverty/nw.htmlWhen I posted this link last week, one of the shero Warrior grandmas I admire, (Debra White Plume) said:""a lot of factual history in this article, please read and share. while it hovers around poverty porn, please remember that we are a resilient people and we do not measure our wealth by the material gains accumulated. we are firstly a spiritual people, and then we are warriors. warriors with a heart full of love and prayer, the strongest weapons of all. come stand with us at the river. come now.""Second, Obama made promises that he should be held to. He must find a way to use his Executive power to put a stop to this; or risk ending his Presidency in disgrace by further capitulating to industry and the corporate-ocracy, against the wishes of a majority of the American People.Obama, Honor the Treaties and honor your words.

240944029279128_1369385579768295,"""The neoliberal era in the United States ended with a neofascist bang. The political triumph of Donald Trump shattered the establishments in the Democratic and Republican parties â€“ both wedded to the rule of Big Money and to the reign of meretricious politicians.The Bush and Clinton dynasties were destroyed by the media-saturated lure of the pseudo-populist billionaire with narcissist sensibilities and ugly, fascist proclivities. The monumental election of Trump was a desperate and xenophobic cry of human hearts for a way out from under the devastation of a disintegrating neoliberal order â€“ a nostalgic return to an imaginary past of greatness.White working- and middle-class fellow citizens â€“ out of anger and anguish â€“ rejected the economic neglect of neoliberal policies and the self-righteous arrogance of elites. Yet these same citizens also supported a candidate who appeared to blame their social misery on minorities, and who alienated Mexican immigrants, Muslims, black people, Jews, gay people, women and China in the process.This lethal fusion of economic insecurity and cultural scapegoating brought neoliberalism to its knees. In short, the abysmal failure of the Democratic party to speak to the arrested mobility and escalating poverty of working people unleashed a hate-filled populism and protectionism that threaten to tear apart the fragile fiber of what is left of US democracy. And since the most explosive fault lines in present-day America are first and foremost racial, then gender, homophobic, ethnic and religious, we gird ourselves for a frightening future.What is to be done? First we must try to tell the truth and a condition of truth is to allow suffering to speak. For 40 years, neoliberals lived in a world of denial and indifference to the suffering of poor and working people and obsessed with the spectacle of success. Second we must bear witness to justice. We must ground our truth-telling in a willingness to suffer and sacrifice as we resist domination. Third we must remember courageous exemplars like Martin Luther King Jr, who provide moral and spiritual inspiration as we build multiracial alliances to combat poverty and xenophobia, Wall Street crimes and war crimes, global warming and police abuse â€“ and to protect precious rights and liberties.The age of Obama was the last gasp of neoliberalism. Despite some progressive words and symbolic gestures, Obama chose to ignore Wall Street crimes, reject bailouts for homeowners, oversee growing inequality and facilitate war crimes like US drones killing innocent civilians abroad.Rightwing attacks on Obama â€“ and Trump-inspired racist hatred of him â€“ have made it nearly impossible to hear the progressive critiques of Obama. The president has been reluctant to target black suffering â€“ be it in overcrowded prisons, decrepit schools or declining workplaces. Yet, despite that, we get celebrations of the neoliberal status quo couched in racial symbolism and personal legacy. Meanwhile, poor and working class citizens of all colors have continued to suffer in relative silence.In this sense, Trump's election was enabled by the neoliberal policies of the Clintons and Obama that overlooked the plight of our most vulnerable citizens. The progressive populism of Bernie Sanders nearly toppled the establishment of the Democratic party but Clinton and Obama came to the rescue to preserve the status quo. And I do believe Sanders would have beat Trump to avert this neofascist outcome!In this bleak moment, we must inspire each other driven by a democratic soulcraft of integrity, courage, empathy and a mature sense of history â€“ even as it seems our democracy is slipping away.We must not turn away from the forgotten people of US foreign policy â€“ such as Palestinians under Israeli occupation, Yemen's civilians killed by US-sponsored Saudi troops or Africans subject to expanding US military presence.As one whose great family and people survived and thrived through slavery, Jim Crow and lynching, Trump's neofascist rhetoric and predictable authoritarian reign is just another ugly moment that calls forth the best of who we are and what we can do.For us in these times, to even have hope is too abstract, too detached, too spectatorial. Instead we must be a hope, a participant and a force for good as we face this catastrophe.""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election","Goodbye, American neoliberalism.

240944029279128_1363594330347420,"""As news of Hillary Clinton's shocking loss sinks in, many Clinton supporters looking for someone to blame are pointing fingers at a familiar scapegoat: people who voted outside the two-party system.Pundits are already trying to blame Libertarian Gary Johnson and me, the Green party candidate, for Trump's win. For example, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow concocted a scenario in which by taking every Stein vote and half of Johnson's votes, Clinton could have grabbed enough states from Trump to eke out an electoral college win, a story repeated by CNN. Unwilling to accept that Clinton didn't motivate enough voters to win the presidency, and explore the reasons why, many pundits are instead looking to put responsibility for the loss onto others.In Maddow's fantasy, where Johnson drops and Clinton inherits half of Libertarian voters, where does the other half go? In reality, exit polls showed that only 25% of Johnson and Stein voters preferred Clinton to 14-15% who preferred Trump, while the majority â€“ 55% of Johnson voters and 61% of Stein voters â€“ simply wouldn't have voted for either. If we were barred from running, Clinton might have gained a net 10-11% of those voters, but still lost solidly.But these hypotheticals are delusional. Candidates can't snap their fingers and make their supporters vote for someone else they don't support. Pundits may think their favored party is entitled to those votes, but actual voters make their own decisions. No candidate owns anyone's vote â€“ votes have to be earned.Looking for scapegoats is a way to avoid reflection, criticism and accountability after failure. Those who claimed that Clinton was more electable than Bernie Sanders, despite his stronger polling against Trump, are now desperately trying to spin the failure of their strategy.Corporate media gives alternative parties just a tiny fraction of their election coverage. When we do get covered, smear campaigns and ""spoiler"" charges dominate the discussion. Incredibly, pundits justify our exclusion from the airwaves and debates by saying we aren't a factor â€“ yet after election day they declare us the most important factor.Calling anyone outside the two-party system a ""spoiler"" with no right to run is anti-democratic. It suppresses political competition, discourages citizen participation in democracy and shields the toxic two-party system from criticism or reform.Alternative party voters don't consider it ""pragmatic"" to perpetuate a two-party system that keeps getting worse. Many of them make deliberate decisions to use their votes to change that system long-term. Yet after making minimal effort to understand these voters, pundits caricature them as selfish idiots, normalizing hateful, bullying behavior and threats towards anyone who steps outside the collapsing two-party box.The American people want more choices, not fewer. Some 57% think a new major party is needed because the establishment parties do such a poor job. 2016 reached a new low with the most disliked candidates in history. If most of us want more choices, shouldn't the media inform us about other candidates on the ballot, instead of attacking them? When can we move past this two-party trap and take our democracy into our own hands?The good news: voters in Maine and elsewhere are tackling the ""spoiler problem"" head on with ranked choice voting. This voting system lets you rank your choices, so if your first choice loses, your vote is automatically reassigned to your second choice. Ranked choice voting empowers you to vote for the candidates who best represent your values. No one can tell you you're ""throwing your vote away"" if you don't vote for the ""lesser evil"" in order to stop the candidate you fear most. Ranked choice voting also rewards both candidates and voters who find common ground with opponents, rather than slamming them with negative attacks.So are the runner-ups of this bitter election merely looking for a scapegoat, or are they willing to work constructively to fix systemic problems? The very fact that the political and media establishment was able to ram two historically unpopular candidates down our collective throats exposes a critical need for greater democracy. Ranked choice voting is an obvious first step.It's said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. So the real question is: who's ready to join us and get to work fixing our broken electoral system?""For more information on Ranked Choice Voting: jill2016.com/RCV",Looking for someone to blame?

We want to acknowledge the real heartache, pain and worry that people of color, women, immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQIA+, poor and working people are feeling.We also wish to express our deep sorrow and outrage at the attacks that many Green Party supporters have been subjected to for months, and even more intensely in the last few days. Our supporters, friends and staff have reported being subjected to a steady stream of harassment, abuse and threats, up to and including death threats.These attacks have not only come from the virulent, racist ranks of Trump supporters, but have also come in large part from Clinton supporters who seem to think it's okay to vilify, swear at, spit on and make threats against those who disagree; those who choose to exercise their right to vote how they see fit; those who have made the decision that the two-party system itself is the problem.Hateful behavior, from wherever it comes from across the political spectrum, must be seen and called out for what it is: deplorable.We must recognize that many people around this country do not feel safe. We must stand with people of color, with immigrants and Indigenous people, with Muslims, Jews, LGBTQIA+ people, women, and all whose rights are threatened. Solidarity must be our guiding principle.We are committed to peaceful, non-violent actions to oppose the racist, sexist, homophobic, and other harmful acts enacted or inspired by a Trump presidency, and provide real protection and support for people of color and communities that come under threat. We also stand with Greens around the country and the world who have endured bullying and threats for having the courage of their convictions to stand up against the establishment and corporate two-party rule.The Stein/Baraka ticket ran a principled campaign that unapologetically stood with marginalized peoples and their struggles around this country. We will stand firm with these communities against all attacks, as well as with our supporters who have stood with us in this dark time. We will stand firm for a truly progressive agenda to put people, planet and peace over profit - the only counterweight to the rising wave of right-wing extremism in the United States and the world.We must stand with each other, take care of each other, and give ourselves the collective strength and support to build our political power.

The Green Party calls for direct actions against the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the lame duck session, and is co-organizing for ""Occupy Inauguration"" demonstrations on January 20 and 21 (also the anniversary of Citizens United). The party also commends several state-level victories for institutional reform in this election, including the passage of ranked-choice voting in Maine.  Ranked Choice Voting would end the role of fear-voting in elections by allowing voters to rank their choices for president  (or other single winner offices) - knowing that if one's first choice loses, their vote is automatically reassigned to their second choice. In addition, the Stein/Baraka campaign praised resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish corporate constitutional rights and the concept of money as speech in Washington and California.""Don't mourn, organize,"" said David Cobb, Stein/Baraka campaign manager. ""This government is premised upon the concept of 'consent of the governed.' We do not consent to Donald Trump and right wing rule. We do not consent to the establishment of corporate rule. We do not consent to Empire. We call for a peaceful, non-violent revolution by the ordinary people who were shut out of this terrible election by the leadership of both corporate political parties. The Green Party is prepared to be an instrument for popular power, and a new politics of integrity that must rise up and replace this rotten two-party system,"" he said.",Stein/Baraka Campaign Calls for Immediate Resistance to Trump and the Failed Two-Party System,link,http://www.jill2016.com/resisttrump,11/9/16 15:37,4719,340,1418,4086,562,16,29,10,16,2016-11-09

240944029279128_1353122118061308,"""Today Green Party Presidential candidate Jill Stein filed a legal complaint before the Federal Election Commission against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's presidential campaigns for having illegally coordinated with Super PACs in violation of campaign finance laws.Stein's complaint outlined a body of evidence indicating that the Clinton campaign has improperly coordinated activities with Super PACs such as Correct the Record, Priorities USA Action, and American Bridge 21st Century, while the Trump campaign has improperly coordinated activities with Super PACs such as Rebuilding America Now, Make America Number 1, and Great America PAC.The Stein/Baraka campaign, which like all Green campaigns has pledged not to accept support from corporate lobbyists or Super PACs, is filing the complaint as the latest step in the Greens' longstanding commitment to eradicate the corrupting influence of big money in politics.Super PACs, which were established by the Citizens United v. FEC Supreme Court ruling, are political advocacy groups known as ""dark money"" groups because they allow for virtually unlimited and unregulated contributions. However, one of the few rules is that political campaigns, which have stricter campaign finance regulations and disclosure requirements, may not coordinate with Super PACs on paid activities. Such coordination would be functionally equivalent to an in-kind donation to the campaign from these dark-money groups.In other words, coordination with Super PACs would allow political campaigns to direct the spending of unlimited amounts of money from undisclosed sources using Super PACs as front organizations, completely destroying the pretense that there are any rules for money in politics at all.This complaint could bring about an end to the illegal collusion between super PACs and campaigns, whereby massive amounts of undisclosed money from corporations and the super rich pour into campaigns in violation of federal election campaign limits.The Green Party has long advocated for a Constitutional Amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, affirming that money is not speech, corporations are not people, and rights belong to living people, not corporations or other legal entities created to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few.The Stein/Baraka campaign and the Green Party believe that ever-increasing amounts of money in politics are a major reason why the establishment parties have become so wildly out of touch with the needs of the American people. This complaint against the Trump and Clinton campaigns is just one step towards getting the big money out of politics so we can get the people back in.""jill2016.com/FEC",An election illegally rigged against the 99%: Jill Stein files legal complaint against Clinton and Trump campaigns for violating Super PAC laws,link,http://jill2016.com/fec,11/7/16 15:46,14687,464,5618,12733,1570,269,29,32,54,2016-11-07

Green Party co-chair and Stein/Baraka staffer Andrea MÃ©rida Cuellar and  Dawn Neptune Adams, an indigenous woman from the Penobscot tribe and member of the Maine Independent Green Party executive committee, and several members of the Colorado Green Party arrived in Standing Rock on Friday, November 4, to support the encampment and direct actions of the water protectors.""Colorado Greens gathered crucial supplies to support the front line water defenders, from pepper spray remedies to food to warm winter clothing,"" said Cuellar. ""Among us is a union teacher, Peggy Robertson of United Opt Out and a Green, who with her son Sam is rebuilding and restocking the camp school and will teach, in the style of Oaxacan teachers.  We are all standing at the ready to serve and take full direction from the Indigenous leaders on the ground,"" she added.""Many Americans have decried the horrific images coming from this front line struggle,"" said Stein/Baraka campaign manager David Cobb. ""But brutal exploitation and oppression has been the lived experience of the indigenous people of this continent for 500 years. Yes, we must stop this pipeline.  We must also come to terms with the history of attempted genocide and colonial conquest,"" Cobb added.The human rights crisis continues to unfold at Standing Rock in North Dakota, where hundreds of water protectors have been arrested, pepper sprayed, shot at with rubber bullets, threatened with sound cannon and brutalized by police forces from seven states for peacefully protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Stein/Baraka campaign recently issued an official statement in support of the water protectors, and called on the US government to honor indigenous treaties and the right to free, prior, and informed consent under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.""The shameful sight of militarized police at Standing Rock, inside the boundaries of treaty land claimed by the Great Sioux Nation through the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, is the latest instance of a continuous thread of colonial oppression against indigenous people since 1492,"" noted Green Party vice-presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka. ""Our campaign is committed to establishing meaningful, respectful dialogue with indigenous peoples and ensuring that U.S. policies do not interfere with their rights to life, dignity, and autonomy.""""President Obama must go to Standing Rock himself, as Ajamu Baraka and I did in September, to witness what is happening,"" said Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President. ""This violation of human rights has no place in our country, nor any other country in the world. The Dakota Access Pipeline must be stopped immediately,"" she continued. ""We must honor the historic role that indigenous people have always played - and must continue to play - in protecting Mother Earth and the ecosystems our lives depend on. As our planet's survival hangs in the balance, it is more critical than ever to respect the rights and sovereignty of our indigenous brothers and sisters - who are protectors for us all.""Find out how you can help: jill2016.com/nodapl",Stein/Baraka Campaign and Green Party Answer Call For Support at Standing Rock,link,http://jill2016.com/standingrocksupport,11/6/16 20:30,3849,99,2068,3308,525,11,1,4,0,2016-11-06

240944029279128_1350300968343423,"""Why I am voting for Jill SteinI've been scolded by friends and strangers, sometimes mildly and sometimes with disdain, for supporting Jill Stein in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Some of the attacks I've received publicly and privately have been surprisingly angry and patronizing. I've been told that I'm a patsy for Donald Trump, that I'm naÃ¯ve, misinformed, elitist, ignorant, and worse.This has been an unusually carnivalesque election so far, from the primary season through to the ""main event"", with a premium on vitriol and mendacity, dominated by a frequently disheartening lack of profundity and objectivity from the mainstream media.This is the poorest two-candidate race for the presidency that I have ever witnessed the corporate media/political Establishment attempt to ram down the throats of the U.S. electorate.So, why am I voting for Jill Stein?I previously supported Bernie Sanders because he was, on many levels, a welcome voice speaking truth to power, drawing attention to rampant institutional economic inequality, racism, corruption in the electoral system, and the urgent need to address climate change. Like a lot of people, I was disappointed when Sanders lost the Democratic Primary race to Hillary Clinton.I hoped at that point that he might join forces with Jill Stein and the Green Party, but he declined that unique opportunity.Bernie never spoke to the all-important issues of U.S. economic and military imperialism the way that Jill Stein has consistently done, but he was a credible voice for change in many other areas. He made his choice to get on the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party bandwagon because he appeared to feel that it would be the best way to prevent a Trump presidency.I understand and respect his stance, shared by many other well-intentioned and thoughtful people, but I believe it is short-sighted. It is not enough to simply say ""I tried, I voted for Bernie in the Democratic Primary, but now I have to get in line behind Hillary.""The powerful few who control national politics and the mainstream media by virtue of their overwhelming economic advantages are counting on supporters of Bernie Sanders and other political alternatives to now support the two Establishment candidates.They are counting on no real change happening in the way this country is run and how average citizens are represented. At some point the system has to be overhauled, and the weeds have to be pulled out by the root. I do not want to reach the end of my life and have to accept that I did not vote my conscience as a citizen when it mattered most.Democracy is not a fixed thing; it is an ongoing process that must be nurtured, pruned, and actively encouraged to grow or it will gradually cease to yield meaningful progress.Times are changing and people all over this land - especially younger voters, who are the future of our republic's continuing democratic experiment - are awake and paying attention. They did not go to sleep when Bernie Sanders largely gave up the fight for significant change in our political-economic system.Like many that supported Bernie, I trust Hillary Clinton about as far as I can throw Donald Trump.Jill Stein is the only candidate with a serious plan to halt climate change and switch to 100% renewable energy by 2030.She's the only candidate, now that Sanders is out of the race, with a plan to release students from impossible levels of debt.She's also the only candidate who is talking seriously about Black Lives Matter, institutional racism, and police brutalityâ€”and she has realistic and workable plans to address these social problems.She is also taking a stand against unexamined military overspending and the irresponsible and often criminal misuse of those who volunteer to serve in our country's armed forces.She eloquently draws attention to the patriots who are forced to fight in illegal, immoral, unnecessary, and unwinnable wars. As she has unflinchingly pointed out, ""This results in a multitude of deaths, injuries (both mental and physical) and presents a crisis of conscience situation for many in combat.Following discharge, veterans are much more likely to commit suicide, become homeless, become dependent on drugs or alcohol, and have significantly higher rates of divorce, spousal and child abuse.""Jill Stein knows that these are problems that have not been honestly addressed, and that it is extremely unfair that those willing to give the ultimate sacrifice for their country are not properly supported or taken care of. Unlike Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, she will never deploy troops into unnecessary or illegal combat.She cares deeply about our country being truly exemplary - in action and not just in high-sounding words uttered by our political leaders - as a member of the family of nations. For these and other positions that Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka hold, I strongly recommend that voters take the time to have a look at the website jill2016.com and follow Jill Stein and the Green Party on social media.You may agree or disagree with Jill on some points, but I sincerely believe that you are doing your conscience a disservice if you ignore her well-considered and constructive proposals.If you feel, as I do, that the issues that only Jill Stein has the courage and decency to fully address need urgently to be part of the national political discourse during this election and beyond, please donate now to Jill's campaign for President.Jill's campaign has been hit hard by the Clinton campaign's fear-mongering, which has seriously driven down donations. You can help push back against these unprincipled attacks by making your defiant contribution today.So, why am I voting for Jill Stein?Because I have done my best to inform myself about the many important issues that face our country, because I am following my conscience as an engaged citizen and a passionate supporter of the democratic process.Because now is the time, not later, because I will not be intimidated by those who operate out of fear of significant change, because I will not be dissuaded by those who are understandably nervous about thinking long-term, about standing firm in the eternal battle for socio-economic justice and true political freedom in this country.Because I am proud to be part of an ongoing, centuries-old democratic experiment that ought to always stand for fairness, compassion, and strength based on common sense and human decency at home and abroad.Because there is always hope.Because all we need to do to help it thrive is to embrace it and cultivate it to the best of our abilities in a conscious effort to eliminate the real obstacles to liberty and justice for all.Viggo Mortensen""http://www.jill2016.com/viggo",Viggo Mortensen Endorses Jill & Ajamu!,link,http://www.jill2016.com/viggo,11/5/16 10:15,17551,711,6879,14286,3138,85,17,8,17,2016-11-05

I'm a Morehouse College professor and a lifelong activist.I've been a Green Party supporter for over a decade.And today, right now, I am giving my wholehearted endorsement to Jill Stein.Why? Because like Jill, I have a clear vision for a just, peaceful, non-racist, and beautiful America.  And frankly, our country is moving in the wrong direction.I'm angry about the wave of neoliberal policies that are killing women, prisoners, and people of color. I'm distressed by the persecution of the poor, the dispossessed, and of our LGBTQ sisters and brothers.Most of all, I'm frustrated that we keep electing politicians with the same worldviews, programs and policies - decade after decade - that got us into this mess in the first place.Despite the fact that 57% of Americans want a new political party, we never invest in them or vote for them...and as a result, we never grow a third party.As a nation, we cannot allow fear to block our broader democratic vision for our country. Instead of voting against someone or something, we need to vote our conscience - we need to vote for a better world. The Green Party has a strategy and a plan to build that world.And for the first time in history the Green Party has a real and viable chance of getting 5% of the national vote.If the Green Party gets 5% of the vote nationwide in this election, our voice ... YOUR VOICE ... will finally be heard. It will mean $8 to $10 million in federal funds next election cycle and visibility like never before. Plus the Green Party candidate will automatically be on the ballot in a number of states. Your vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka is an investment in that possibility. It's an investment in the effort to transform this corrupt and decayed system - a system that favors the powerful at the expense of the powerless - into one that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.I know the transformative changes a Stein administration will bring about. I've listened as Jill has outlined her programs that will promote freedom, justice, and true democracy.Your vote is the first step.""http://www.jill2016.com/MarcHill",Marc Lamont Hill Endorses Jill & Ajamu!,link,http://www.jill2016.com/MarcHill,11/4/16 11:00,5219,114,1549,4457,712,39,6,1,4,2016-11-04

240944029279128_1345795212127332,"""Donald Trump's self-inflicted wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the public-opinion needle toward Hillary Clinton, according to recent polls. That may have changed a little in the aftermath of the FBI's renewing of its email probe last week. But even so, the fears of many voters that a Donald Trump presidency might become a reality have abated.Those fears are not unfounded. Trump's failings as a candidate and a person are manifest, and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected. That's especially true at the agency level, with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power. The wildcard aspect of his personality poses risks that can't be predicted, nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging initiatives.What has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the Republican nominee's outrageous behavior, bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate, however, is a critical examination of what a Clinton administration will mean for the nation. The FBI probe, information on tangled interests within the Clinton Foundation, evidence of influence peddling and Wikileaks revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic process, signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal level.The content of what has been revealed in these leaks, as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable conclusion: Hillary Clinton represents the entrenched interests of the status quo. Her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized US policies for several decades â€“ at tremendous, almost incalculable cost both domestically and internationally.During the campaign, Clinton has engaged in the type of saber-rattling one expects of presidential candidates, especially Democrats who seek to counter the party's image as weak on defense. She has agitated against Russian President Putin on Ukraine and Syria, and reiterated her belief in ""the responsibility to protect,"" the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years â€“ even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere. A muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered US allies, yet Clinton supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of President Obama without a hint of irony.The ill-advised and tragic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to extract a heavy toll, and though opposition to those wars helped propel Barack Obama into office, the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the government's ongoing crusade, the so-called War on Terror. In reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the US has waged around the world, the deadly manifestations of the War on Terror have largely been met with silence or, depressingly, approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement. Sadly, Donald Trump's self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question Clinton's unabashed cheerleading for a continuation of these modified Cold-War strategies.Beyond the battlefield, Clinton's historical enthusiasm for ""free"" but not fair trade â€“ even while waffling on the TPP â€“ gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served. In the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the world, the Obama administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements. As Secretary of State, Clinton had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so. Why would anyone expect her to change now?The inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the Green Party, which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down U.S. military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home.This election is about far more than our collective distaste for a hyper-inflated ego, and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of Trump for the clear and present danger of Clinton's corporatist logic is no trade-off at all.""jill2016.com/finalstretch",Don't settle for the lesser of two evils in this election.

240944029279128_1342865919086928,"If President Hillary is inevitable, why are her media goons still attacking Jill Stein?by Caitlin Johnstone""Methinks the lady doth protest too much.""This phrase has become very useful in our current political environment. It's a line from one of those Shakespeare plays where everyone dies in the end, and its use has become a way of pointing out when someone's frantic resistance to something reveals a lot more about their true agendas than they intended to let on. When you know that your government is lying to you and the media is helping them, such things can often be a useful way of figuring out exactly what's going on.Take for example the way corporate media, proven by WikiLeaks to be pervasively controlled by the Clintons and their allies far more than we ever knew, has continued to run smear pieces on Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, even while they assure everyone that Hillary has an insurmountable lead over Donald Trump.Attack editorials and smear pieces about Stein have been churned out by Clinton-allied media like cheap t-shirts at a Bangladeshi sweat shop since well before the Green Party convention, but lately, the frenzied attacks are getting even louder and more desperate. Last week John Oliver, whose employer HBO is owned by heavyweight Clinton contributor Time Warner, dedicated an entire rant to punching down on third parties and their supporters. Yesterday the Daily Beast, whose owner IAC is co-directed by Chelsea Clinton herself, ran a hit piece on the good doctor hilariously accusing her of having a ""conflict of interest"" because she has a standard investment portfolio.I'm just going to type that out again because it makes my smug parts light up with glee: a publication, controlled by Hillary Clinton's daughter, ran a hit piece on Jill Stein, for having a conflict of interest.My God that's good. I need a cigarette.Jill Stein, if you haven't been following, is the only candidate on the ballot who has never been a Republican, the only candidate on the ballot who doesn't hate progressives, and the only candidate on the ballot pushing an actual progressive agenda. That means she's going to be pulling votes from people who would otherwise support Hillary ""candidates must have a public position and a private position"" Clinton, who is currently pretending to care about progressives so they'll give her the power to privatize social security and start a war with Russia.Oh, but Hillary doesn't need those votes, does she? The official narrative all over corporate media is that Clinton is now a shoe-in. ESPN's monolithic poll-crunching juggernaut FiveThirtyEight has Clinton as a very heavy favorite to win the election, its editor-in-chief Nate Silver reassuring us that ""Trump's chances of winning the election haven't improved very much in our forecast."" You will remember Nate Silver as the inventor of the specious argument that Bernie Sanders is basically the same as Hillary Clinton because they ""voted together 93% of the time when in Congress together,"" which is an incredibly disingenuous manipulation of the data, as Counterpunch reports. You may also remember Silver as the man whose Clinton-favoring system incorrectly predicted Hillary winning a number of the states she ended up losing to Bernie Sanders in the primary.Could it be that these folks are not nearly as confident in the results as they pretend to be? Are the Democrats' weighted polling practices as reported by Zero Hedge still being employed to discourage Trump voters and paint Clinton as an unstoppable force? If Hillary's lead has swelled to insurmountability, why have the attacks on Jill Stein increased instead of decreased? Is she taking far more votes from Clinton than the Nate Silvers are letting us know?Or is it broader than that? Is it simply that in this era of WikiLeaks, alternative media, and widespread internet access, too many people are opening their eyes and looking toward true rebels like Jill Stein? Are they so desperate to keep the progressives from taking over their party or replacing it that they need to grasp at straws by sponsoring hit pieces attacking her for having a standard investment portfolio?How obnoxious is that, by the way? Jill Stein is trending on Facebook. That would usually fill me with happiness, but no, she's trending because of that stupid Chelsea Clinton smear piece. I can't believe this is getting traction at all. So this gets traction, but the email revealing Bill Clinton having ""500 conflicts of interest"" holds no interest for people? The same people who were outraged about Bernie's little retirement house are banging on about this too, but you never hear them get outraged about Hillary's $12 million appearance fee or Bill's million dollar ""gift"" from head chopping warlords.The stupid is killing us. The stupid will kill us all.People have a really screwed up sense of equivalency. In the minds of many, apparently, Jill's mutual fund having a few oil shares in it is the same as hundreds of millions in actual corporate conflicts of interest where political favors are being bought and sold for money? How do people even compute it that way?But it's always the same people, have you noticed that? The most amoral people are having a field day with this as if morals have any meaning for them at all. With the Clintons, any amount of criminality is just normal everyday stuff to them, they don't understand why anybody's making a fuss, in fact, the proof that she's such a great criminal makes them like her more. These same people suddenly become more pernickety and pious than your churchy Aunt Pearl when it comes to Jill Stein. Doesn't matter that Hillary actively sells fracking, Jill raising a few questions about the safety of GMO cucumbers is a deal-breaker. Doesn't matter that Hillary is blatantly shoving us headlong into war with Russia, Jill had some concerns about vaccines in her capacity as a doctor once. And now this.She probably drives a car, you know. Good god, she probably uses gas for her cooking.No, you're right Hillary people, she should definitely not fight the oil companies that are destroying our species while she's still using an iPhone.In fact, we should all shut up about the impending climate apocalypse until we've rid our own person completely of oil and plastics.At the end of the day, I'm so glad we're shutting down the only candidate in the race who is speaking up for the environment because her managed fund has some oil shares in it, just like pretty much everyone else's does. That's a really good, moral decision. Right? Let's spend all our intelligence defending the share portfolios of billionaires by smothering the presidential campaign of the only progressive candidate on the ballot. The only candidate who hasn't been a Republican. The only one who has a comprehensive plan for climate change.Good thinking, humans. You're really hitting that one out of the park.Ugh. I'm going to go lie down. Remember, dear reader, ignore their stories and watch their actions. Forget their narrative about what's happening, and watch what really makes them squeal. When it comes to Jill Stein, they protest too much. Keep your bright eyes right there.""","If President Hillary Is Inevitable, Why Are Her Media Goons Still Attacking Jill Stein?",link,http://www.inquisitr.com/3653684/if-president-hillary-is-inevitable-why-are-her-media-goons-still-attacking-jill-stein/,11/1/16 0:00,5274,312,1914,4673,393,34,127,9,38,2016-11-01

After a voter has cast a provisional ballot, election officials determine whether or not to count the provisional ballot by verifying the voter's eligibility .  Sometimes states require voters to take additional steps to verify their eligibility in order for the provisional ballot to count such as submitting an acceptable form of identification at a board of elections office within a specified time period after Election Day.   It is important to know that many poll workers are improperly trained to handle provisional ballots, and may fail to inform voters' of their right to cast a provisional ballot.  Poll workers may also mistakenly misinform an eligible voter entitled to cast a regular ballot that the voter must instead cast provisional ballot. Voters should therefore insist on their right to cast a normal ballot when their eligibility has not been challenged or called into question, and their right to cast a provisional ballot the voter believes he or she is eligible to vote but eligibility cannot be immediately determined.  Voters facing any issues on Election Day should not hesitate to contact 866-OUR-VOTE for assistance.Voters should be aware that areas with high percentages of racial and ethnic minority voters have the highest rates of provisional ballots, and a large proportion of these ballots are typically rejected.  Therefore, voters should take steps in advance of Election Day to ensure they will be able to cast a regular ballot, such as verifying they are registered to vote and ensuring they have the proper form of identification required by state law.  Visit www.866ourvote.org to assist you with these steps.There are no clear and uniform standards for counting provisional ballots.  For example, many states do not count provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct, while others do.  Provisional ballots are typically rejected for one of four reasons: (1) the voter is not registered to vote; (2) the voter cast the provisional ballot in the wrong precinct or jurisdiction; (3) the voter did not complete or sign the provisional ballot; or (4) the voter did not provide sufficient identification.  Though it may be difficult on Election Day for a voter to know whether his or her provisional ballot will be counted, under the Help America Vote Act ALL states are required to provide provisional voters an opportunity to find out afterwards whether their provisional ballot was counted or rejected and, if rejected, the reasons for the rejection.Voters concerned about filling out provisional ballots should not hesitate to call 866-OUR-VOTE for further information.VOTER INTIMIDATION (from Election Protection)Voter intimidation involves putting undue pressure on or trying to coerce a person or group to suppress votes or to vote a certain way. There is an ugly history of voter intimidation targeting low-income and minority voters.  More recently, deceptive election practices have become more widespread, taking the place of historical state-sanctioned discrimination in voting like  literacy tests and poll taxes. These practices include the dissemination of false election information sent out through flyers, robocalls, the internet, and through social media, and low-income and minority voters remain frequent targets.  Some of the more notorious examples of voter intimidation include:Voters being threatened with arrest at their polling station if they have unpaid child support or unpaid parking tickets.Misleading robocalls to African-Americans in Maryland stating that there was no need to go vote because ""our goals have been met"".Fliers in Ohio and Virginia telling voters that Republicans vote on the actual election day while Democrats vote the day after.Challenges to African-American voters in Philadelphia by men carrying clipboards who drove a fleet of sedans with signs that looked like law enforcement insignia.Voters concerned that they are being targeted by deceptive election practices, in addition to alerting local authorities, should immediately contact 1-866-OUR-VOTE, because it is very unlikely they are the only ones and these practices must be stopped.VOTER CHALLENGERS (from Election Protection)Generally, voter challengers can question the eligibility of a voter on Election Day before a voter completes and casts a ballot. Depending on state law, these challengers might be appointed by political parties or other organizations. Voter challenges are often fraught with discriminatory practices and can intimidate qualified voters from voting. Also, the problem voter challenger systems supposedly address â€“ voter fraud â€“ is mostly illusory.Challengers also cause Election Day confusion by creating delays and uncertainty, and can easily intimidate voters, particularly because mass challenges might be based solely upon the race of voters. An Ohio Republican Party plan in 2004, for example, would have involved challengers confronting 97% of new African-American voters in one location while only 14% of new voters in a majority white precinct would face a challenger.http://www.jill2016.com/votingproblemshttp://www.jill2016.com/rigged",Election Protection Â· You Have the Right to Vote,link,http://www.866ourvote.org/,10/31/16 19:30,740,57,254,669,47,7,0,15,2,2016-10-31

But ...She does not support the $15 minimum wage.She shows no support for legalizing marijuana.She supports TPP.She has sold fracking and Monsanto.She supports offshore drilling.She has no position on the Dakota Access Pipeline.She opposes the labeling of GMOs.She opposes the breakup of big banks.She takes lobbyists' money for campaigning.She opposes a binding climate treaty.She supports unconditional military aid to Israel.I'm therefore very happy to endorse Jill Stein for the presidency because she does stand for everything I believe in.It's clear a third party is necessary and viable at this time. And this is the first step in accomplishing this end.Fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption.Now that Trump is self-destructing, I feel even those in swing states have the opportunity to vote their conscience.""- Written by Susan Sarandonjill2016.com/sarandon",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/drjillstein/photos/a.267467419960122.70392.240944029279128/1343778862328967/?type=3,10/31/16 13:46,13346,876,5729,10708,2425,116,30,18,49,2016-10-31

240944029279128_1342946029078917,"Open Letter from the Social Media Director of the Stein/Baraka CampaignMy name is Jillian, and I have had the honor of being the Social Media Director for the Stein/Baraka campaign over the last couple months. What I believe to be most importantâ€”when you have a large social media platform such as Jill and Ajamu'sâ€”is to make sure you are being transparent, holding your own self accountable for mistakes, and addressing the needs of the community members for whom you have the privilege of serving. I would never want to post a response article written by me onto Jill Stein's Facebook page, but after hearing the audio tape of Hillary Clinton advocating for a rigged Palestinian election, I now have a profound understanding of the harm that will come if she is President of the United States. And I feel it is my dutyâ€”as a human beingâ€”to properly address why I am fighting so hard against it. Why so many of us are fighting this hard.--A Clinton presidency is D A N G E R O U S .And no, I'm not just saying that because of her white-privileged faux feminism. Google it. My vote is indeed... going... to a woman (and a white one at that).I do not want someone in office that knows the system the way Clinton does. If Obama can do what he's done, it scares the hell out of me to think about the damage and destruction Hillary will causeâ€”and how much power the 99 percent will lose in the process.You're right when you say she knows politics like no other politician.Hillary Clinton, you will never get this vote.""He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it."" - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.I say that because in THIS election, those words have never made more sense to me than they do today. People will not survive the status quo, or even a tiny bit better than the status quo.We need a profound shift in how this country operates.We need to be having conversations about how we build a better tomorrow, not about how we slow down a horrific today.Do you see the Dakota Access Pipeline? Do you see the oil spills (two just this week)? Do you see black bodies bleeding out because of a system we enable, or the black and brown bodies abroad that are dying at the hands of the U.S.â€”paid for by you and me? That's our hard-earned money enabling the killing of those bodies. Do you hear how disgusting that sounds? Do you not see why our hands are not clean, and that yesâ€”I'm going to say itâ€”we, The Great United States of America, might be a major part of the problem? Do you not pay attention to the world-renowned life-time giving scientists who are telling us we will see coastal flooding by 2050â€”do you wish for a time when we are rationing water? Do you not see that we are breaching agreements to cause a fight with Russia over air, land, oil and money, because we always need more, and more, and more? WWIIIâ€”are you prepared for that? Do you not understand that you can have two completely separate thoughtsâ€”one about internet security, and one about the content that's in these frigging emails? What are you so scared to seeâ€”that we might not actually be saviors?So yes: If a Trump presidency would mean that we have to fight ignorants in the streetsâ€”I'm ready for that. I know that kind of racism. We already live in that kind of racism everydayâ€”let's bring it to light and start calling it out. It is time you start asking yourself some tough questions: Why are you so eagerly okay staying in the status quo, when you know that that same status quo continues to leave far too many Black children fatherless and motherless because of the color of their skin? This status quo continues to desecrate the sacred burial grounds and prayer ceremoniesâ€”do you think this would ever happen to Arlington Cemetery, or churches? Can you imagine not being able to turn on your faucet since 2014 because it is poisoned? Have you heard of Flint, Michigan? We have been forced to deal with all this because the deep embedded racism that formed this country is the FOUNDATION of our system. And this is just the damage being done in our country, and please, I haven't even begun to kind-of scratch the surface here. Could you imagine what the United States would be doing if Russia suddenly started putting their troops in Canada and Mexico? That is what we are doing to them right now. How can you even begin to have a real conversation when you are already drawing your gun before they've opened their mouth. Our police execute Black bodies like this regularlyâ€”isn't it obvious who they learned that from?Trump is a product of our society. He is not the root cause.The racism that eerily creeps and lurks and twists and controls the oppression we've not ever escapedâ€”and has convinced you that we are saviorsâ€”is a power that scares the sh*t out of me. And the willful ignorance of those you thought were your allies, is an excruciating painâ€”a pain my grandmother once told me about, but had never taken real meaning until now.This is why I am proud to cast my vote for Dr. Jill Stein and Mr. Ajamu Baraka. I know I'm on the right side of history. And I say that not to be snide, cocky or arrogantâ€”I say that because I feel unburdened. And I feel empowered to do the things I know we have to do to truly fix our system, even if that means taking a left turn to get on the right path.A majority of Americans, didn't support MLK at the time he was fighting and only began appreciating him after he was assassinated.I've learned that lesson, and I know where the lesser evil/split-vote banter gets you. I will not be responsible for what Clinton's presidency will end up producing.Now is the time for a strategic voteâ€”one that puts us in a position to have an honest dialogue about topics we should have had far too many deaths ago.For all those fighting, thank you for being brave. For all those feeling beaten down, trust me when I say... they are feeling our power. #KeepPushing #StrategicVoteXO,Jillian#VoteGreen2016http://observer.com/2016/10/2006-audio-emerges-of-hillary-clinton-proposing-rigging-palestine-election",2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,link,http://observer.com/2016/10/2006-audio-emerges-of-hillary-clinton-proposing-rigging-palestine-election,10/31/16 11:00,3396,606,1977,2495,329,266,31,32,243,2016-10-31

240944029279128_1340292052677648,"I say the U.S. elections may be riggedâ€”but not how Trump thinks.Here's my statement:""Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are raising unprecedented doubts â€“ from very different directions â€“ about the reliability of the upcoming vote count,"" said Jill Stein, Green Party Presidential candidate. ""Trump conjures up fictional armies of people engaged in 'voter fraud.' The mainstream media and the Democrats are obsessed with ""Russian hackers."" In the meantime, President Obama scoffs at the notion of election rigging. But in fact, there are serious election integrity issues in the US that we need to address. Just as important, the system is rigged to ensure that the Democratic and Republican parties continue to dominate while political competition is effectively barred.""""The rigging of our political system to prevent competition begins with anti-democratic and discriminatory ballot access laws that force parties like the Greens to gather massive numbers of signatures, often much more than the establishment parties need, simply to appear on the ballot. After we spend our resources getting on the ballot, the media gives us less than 1% the coverage given to the establishment candidates, while constantly reinforcing the narrative that political competition is futile or worse. This marginalization leads to low poll numbers in polls that significantly undercount young people and independents, which happen to be the demographics that are most likely to vote Green. Then these poll numbers are used to justify locking ballot-qualified candidates out of debates and media coverage. This is clearly a self-perpetuating cycle that keeps the establishment parties in control, even when voters are ready to revolt in disgust against the candidates they've chosen,"" said Stein. ""This is a failing system badly in need of reforms such as ranked choice voting, an improved voting system that is on the statewide ballot in Maine.""Social scientists have already debunked Trump's myth of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University stated that ""it is more likely that an individual will be struck by lightning than he will impersonate another voter at the polls.""""People who worry about the integrity of our elections should be more concerned with the well-documented suppression of minority and poor voters by partisan secretaries of state and other election officials,"" said Ajamu Baraka, Green Vice Presidential candidate. ""Since the 2000 presidential election, a variety of techniques have been employed to disenfranchise large numbers of eligible voters, including voter ID laws, the deliberate purging of registered voters, the elimination of voting sites in minority neighborhoods and on college campuses, and intimidation at the polls.""In their full statement, Stein and Baraka pointed to documented evidence of major elections tainted by voter suppression, voter roll purges, and other troubling issues.""A Stein/Baraka administration will propose federal legislation providing for universal national voter registration and election procedures,"" said Stein. ""We call for immediate measures to help protect the vote on November 8, including:Electronic voting machines must have an auditable paper-based ballot trail.Immediately post-election, there must be a mandatory random audit of three percent of all ballots.Open source code must be used to verify the vote count in states that use secret proprietary software. Systems like this, such as the Trachtenberg system, exist and are already in use.All election jurisdictions with electronic ballot imaging technology and audit features must turn both these features on during the elections, and make ballot images and audit logs available as public records.It is vital to the integrity of our elections and our democracy that every vote be counted.

240944029279128_1339044182802435,"The Stein/Baraka campaign is horrified and outraged at the militarized repression of water protectors at the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. Police and private security forces have engaged in violent actions against peaceful earth defenders who have come to protect the land and water from the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We condemn the violent repression of the peaceful protests against DAPL as human rights abuses, including the use of attack dogs and pepper spray against peaceful demonstrators, the persecution of journalists, the authorization of weaponized drones, the disruption of prayer ceremonies, and the desecration of sacred burial sites. These are not the actions of public servants sworn to protect and serve the community, but the unconscionable oppression of an occupying army against the original inhabitants of this land.The water protectors have invoked their rights under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which grants the Sioux Nation sovereignty over the territory. A Stein/Baraka administration would honor the Sioux claims under this treaty, as well as the right to free, informed, and prior consent under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We call for an immediate halt to the construction of the pipeline and all attempts on the part of the police to remove the water protectors.We express our outrage and shame at the silence of the Obama administration and the other presidential candidates in regards to this human rights crisis. We stand with the 14-year-old girl who traveled to the Clinton campaign headquarters from Standing Rock today to deliver a letter appealing to Hillary Clinton for support. She was turned away at the door and the letter was not even accepted for review. The Dakota Access Pipeline is not only a human rights crisis for indigenous peoples, but a catastrophic ecological crisis that will affect millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking water. There have been over 3,000 pipeline accidents in the United States since 2010, including deadly explosions and spills that have contaminated whole ecosystems. In the past week alone, two pipelines have burst, including a massive incident on the Sunoco pipeline in Pennsylvania which dumped 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River. There is zero expectation that the Dakota Access pipeline will be free of such problems, and could be even worse as it is intended to carry Bakken shale oil, one of the dirtiest and most volatile types of fossil fuel on the planet.For hundreds of years, the U.S. government has stolen land from and brutalized indigenous peoples across this continent, prioritizing resource extraction for private profit over the public interest. The menacing presence of extractive industries throughout indigenous territories threatens everyone's survival. We cannot afford to continue putting corporate profits over people and the planet. Our campaign is committed to establishing meaningful, respectful dialogue with indigenous peoples and ensuring that U.S. policies do not interfere with their rights to life, dignity, and autonomy. We call for an end to these deadly practices, to eliminate fossil fuel dependency through a transition to 100% clean energy by 2030, and to respect indigenous rights as the first crucial step to building a better world.Read on our website: jill2016.com/standingwithstandingrock","Stein/Baraka Campaign Condemns Police Actions, Calls to Honor Treaties with Standing Rock Sioux",link,http://jill2016.com/standingwithstandingrock,10/27/16 20:45,10384,318,5925,8416,430,33,4,599,902,2016-10-27

We have always been clear that the path to a progressive revolution does not go through the Democratic Party, a position that Sen. Sanders had shared through most of his political career. And while we agree with Senator Sanders on many issues, including both analysis and solutions, there are also some significant differences that would have to be addressed. This starts with foreign policy and the role of the US military, but includes specific domestic issues as well the abolition of student debt and the need to transition to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030.http://www.jill2016.com/statement_clarifying_sanders_offer",Statement clarifying Sanders offer,link,http://www.jill2016.com/statement_clarifying_sanders_offer,7/9/16 12:09,6333,420,1375,5778,484,53,8,4,6,2016-07-09
