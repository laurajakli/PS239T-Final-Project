889307941125736_1343809752342217,"Hillary for America general counsel Marc Elias on listening and responding to calls for an audit and recount:""Over the last few days, officials in the Clinton campaign have received hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton. The concerns have arisen, in particular, with respect to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania â€” three states that together proved decisive in this presidential election and where the combined margin of victory for Donald Trump was merely 107,000 votes.It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted.Moreover, this election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the ""fake news"" propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election.For all these reasons, we have quietly taken a number of steps in the last two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in the vote tally in these critical battleground states.First, since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia.Second, we have had numerous meetings and calls with various outside experts to hear their concerns and to discuss and review their data and findings. As a part of this, we have also shared out data and findings with them. Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks.Third, we have attempted to systematically catalogue and investigate every theory that has been presented to us within our ability to do so.Fourth, we have examined the laws and practices as they pertain to recounts, contests and audits.Fifth, and most importantly, we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses â€” where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night. During that process, we have seen Secretary Clinton's vote total grow, so that, today, her national popular vote lead now exceeds more than 2 million votes.In the coming days, we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results. For instance, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conduct post-election audits using a sampling of precincts. Michigan and many other states still do not. This is unfortunate; it is our strong belief that, in addition to an election canvass, every state should do this basic audit to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election.Beyond the post-election audit, Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced Friday that she will exercise her right as a candidate to pursue a recount in the state of Wisconsin. She has indicated plans to also seek recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan.Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states â€” Michigan â€” well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself.The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort to investigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities. While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation of results, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.""",,status,,11/26/16 23:28,171817,19153,23678,146316,20201,2921,1225,192,962,2016-11-26

889307941125736_1324421317614394,"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I'm sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built togetherâ€”this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we loveâ€”and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in Americaâ€”and I always will. And if you do, too, then we must accept this resultâ€”and then look to the future.Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other thingsâ€”the rule of law, the principle that we're all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things tooâ€”and we must defend them.And let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyoneâ€”for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you.I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.To Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful, determined leadership, and so do I.To Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.You crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it mostâ€”even 4-month-old Aidan traveling with his mom.I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans, this was a campaign after a campaign â€” for some of you, this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.To all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebookâ€”even in secret or in private: Thank you.To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.And to all the young people in particular, I want you to hear this. I've spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacksâ€”sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.This loss hurts. But please, please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. It's always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone willâ€”hopefully sooner than we might think right now.And to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.Finally, I am grateful to our country for all it has given me.I count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nationâ€”our best days are still ahead of us.You know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that.Scripture tells us: ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.""My friends, let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",,status,,11/9/16 13:51,1104780,76222,151184,778938,174936,1416,5495,142148,1847,2016-11-09

That's her North Star. That's what guides her. She believes in that. She believes we can summon what's best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.  That's what America is about. We are a country like no other not because of the size of our skyscrapers or the power of our armies, but because we are a place founded for the sake of an idea. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' We don't have to be born into wealth or privilege in this country. We don't have to practice a certain faith. We don't have to have a certain last name. We just have to be willing to contribute. We just have to be willing to put our shoulder to the wheel of history, and we can be a part of this community that we call America.  That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. That's what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what made America exceptional. That's what makes America great.  In other words, America depends on youâ€”you, all of you. America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. I didn't say 'Yes, I can.' I said, 'Yes, we can.' It's about what can be achieved by us, each of us, together, through that hard, slow, and, yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government.

Chip in now to say you're standing with Hillary: hrc.io/donatenow""By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI. This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director Jim Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, 'no reasonable prosecutor' would have brought charges.Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with less than 11 days until Election Day. Voters deserve answers.Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than weeks before the election.Here's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing.The facts be damnedâ€”Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today.These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can. We can't let him get away with this.Our organizers and volunteers on the ground are rallying behind Hillary in what will be the biggest volunteer weekend of the campaign so far. You need to have her back, too. You need to say you're not willing to let Trump bully or buy his way into the presidency, and you're not going to let anything stop us from making history.There are ten days to go. Let's buckle down, stay focused, and win this. Chip in here: hrc.io/donatenow""",,status,,10/29/16 18:38,40227,8834,4452,35865,3186,122,679,64,311,2016-10-29

He's called immigrants """"rapists"""" and ""criminals,"" proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country, demeaned women and said they should be punished for getting an abortion, insulted our veterans, and the list goes on.And the scary thing is, Mike Pence has actually implemented a lot of the dangerous ideas Trump supports in Congress and as governor of Indianaâ€”from defunding Planned Parenthood and all but eliminating access to safe and legal abortion, to codifying discrimination against LGBT people and outlawing higher minimum wages.So tonight, Pence faces a choice: Will he fall on his sword to defend Trump's indefensible and offensive policies and statements, or will he hang his running mate out to dry? Will he ignore the facts and back up Trump's lies, or will he acknowledge the truth on some of Trump's biggest falsehoods?Tim believes tonight's debate should be about the issues facing American families because that's what he's been fighting for his whole life.

They are a time to recall our past year, take a hard look at what we've done and what we've said, and ask how we can do better in the year ahead.  They challenge us to do the difficult work of self-reflectionâ€”key to becoming a better family member, friend, and neighbor.Our country must do this work as a national community, too. All Americans should question whether we're doing all that we can to work on Tikkun Olamâ€”repairing the world. That means asking ourselves if we could be doing more to help those who are hungry or in need of shelter. If we could be doing more to make sure everyone has access to health care. And if we could be doing more to build a brighter future where no one is left out or left behind. It's critical to ask these tough questions. And then, at the conclusion of the High Holidays, it's even more important to get to work and answer them.Many of the complex challenges we face as a nation are dauntingâ€”but luckily, we don't have to face them alone. We are stronger together, and if we commit to work in good faith with one another, surely we can build a better world for future generations.This year's High Holidays are saddened by the passing of President Shimon Peres, a man whose life's work exemplifies the notion of Tikkun Olam. Let us honor his legacy by continuing to strengthen the bonds between the American and Israeli people, and by never wavering in our quest for peace.May the coming year be filled with sweetness and joy.",,status,,10/2/16 17:56,22117,1742,1805,20067,1947,23,51,8,21,2016-10-02

No, she gets right back up, and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most. And here is what is also trueâ€”and I want you all to think about this: Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planetâ€”and clearly the only person in this raceâ€”who has any idea what this job entails, who has seen it from every angle. Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thingâ€”she still wants to take it on. See, because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. That is why she's running.""Now, let me tell you, that is what dedication looks like. That is what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying they don't feel inspired in this electionâ€”well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job. And here's what I absolutely know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That's why I'm inspired by Hillary. I'm inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidencyâ€”not Barack; not Bill. And, yes, happens to be a woman.  ""So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we knowâ€”that beingpresident isn't anything like reality TV. It's not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches. It's about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country. So, ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate's words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we shareâ€”values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others?

889307941125736_1248391811884012,"It was great to be back on the campaign trail yesterday. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good.I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances, and sitting home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be with just two months until Election Day.But having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends and spent time with our very sweet dogs. And I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then.People like meâ€”we're lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck.Lots of Americans still don't even have insuranceâ€”or they do, but it's too expensive to actually use. So they toss back Tylenols, chug orange juice, and hope that cough or cold or virus goes away on its own.And lots of working parents can't afford child care. It costs as much as college tuition in many states, so millions of moms and dads have no backup if they get sickâ€”they're on their own. I've met so many people living on a razor's edgeâ€”one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home.Events like these are mere bumps in the road for some familiesâ€”but for others, they are catastrophic. And that disparity goes against everything we stand for as Americans.Some things shouldn't come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for every American, no matter whatâ€”like financial security, affordable health care, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay.That's why I got into this race: to fight for everyone working hard, often against the odds, to support their families and contribute to our country. I want to tear down all the barriers standing in their way.I'm running for the factory workers and food servers who on their feet all dayâ€”and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for the young people who dream of changing our country and world for the better, and I'm running for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can to their education.Now, we're in the final stretch. There are just 53 days left. I'm going to be campaigning hard all the way until Election Day, talking about my ideas for our country everywhere I goâ€”from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to, yes, guaranteed paid family leave, so that no one in this country ever has to choose between taking care of their family (or themselves) and a paycheck.We need a president who's spent years fighting for these issues, and who has a plan to support all families, in all their configurations. And if I have the honor of serving as your president, no one will fight harder for your children and your familiesâ€”because this is the work of my life, and I'm not stopping now.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/photos/a.889773484412515.1073741828.889307941125736/1248391811884012/?type=3,9/16/16 7:00,64979,5274,7058,55980,8593,170,129,14,93,2016-09-16

Yet too many Americans still face systemic racism and constant assaults on their franchise. Something is profoundly wrong when decades after Dr. King addressed the nation, so many Americans still feel that their country values them less, simply because of the color of their skin.That's just one reason why the stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before. Those brave men and women who marched, and sat, and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain.As President, I'll stand up to bluster and bigotry, and fight back against efforts to restrict access to the ballot. Let's make it easier for people to vote, not harder. Let's make sure every state has at least 20 days of in-person voting, and no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot. And let's automatically register every American to vote on their 18th birthday.The power of American democracy comes from the fact that no one is left behindâ€”no matter where they come from, what they look like, or who they love. That's what I mean when I say that we're stronger together.So today, let's continue to be inspired by the self-evident truths that first united our nation, and live up to what a young minister dreamed and declared fifty-three years ago.",,status,,8/28/16 11:07,14089,2069,1299,12787,1177,56,30,7,32,2016-08-28

But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen's manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high.Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers.That's outrageous -- and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases. But it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.That's why I've put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I've made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value.  Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. In addition, when it comes to treatments like delivering epinephrine that have been available for decades, my plan encourages the production of alternative products. That's how we can harness the power of competition to keep drug prices at a level that all Americans can afford.",,status,,8/24/16 12:19,22643,2598,3243,19767,1431,71,29,116,1229,2016-08-24

Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense reforms like ending racial profiling, providing better training on de-escalation and implicit bias, and supporting municipalities that refer the investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies.

By overturning restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court has rightfully upheld every woman's fundamental right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives.To everyone who flooded the Texas Capitol to speak out against these attacks on women's health, to the brave women and men across the country who shared their stories, and to the health care providers who fought for their patients and refused to give up: this victory belongs to you. I applaud you, and I thank you.But our fight is far from over. In Texas, throughout the South, and across the country, a woman's constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016, states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion. We've seen a concerted, persistent attack on women's health and rights at the federal level. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortionsâ€”as if women, particularly low-income women and women of color, didn't already face enough barriers to exercising their basic rights. He also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.Today's decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election. We need a president who will not only defend women's health and rightsâ€”including appointing Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v. Wade as settled lawâ€”but expand them, by overturning the Hyde Amendment, protecting funding for Planned Parenthood, and building on the Affordable Care Act and its benefits for women's health.

They enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day.

They need to stop playing political games with our democracy and give Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and vote.

889307941125736_1165840096805851,"On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare: Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected it, a man with a gun in his hands and hate in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americansâ€”and, by extension, against the openness and diversity that define our way of life.No matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people always breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security, and makes us furious. So many of us are praying for everyone who was killed, for the wounded and those still missing, and for all the loved ones grieving today. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through. But we owe their memories and their families more than prayer. We must also take decisive action to strengthen our international alliances and combat acts of terror, to keep weapons of war off our streets, and to affirm the rights of LGBT Americansâ€”and all Americansâ€”to feel welcome and safe in our country.Here's what we absolutely cannot do: We cannot demonize Muslim people. Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. Islamophobia goes against everything we stand for as a nation founded on freedom of religion, and it plays right into the terrorists' hands.We're a big-hearted, fair-minded country. We teach our children that this is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for allâ€”not just for people who look a certain way, or love a certain way, or worship a certain way.I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country: You have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them. From Stonewall to Laramie and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly, and without fear has been marked by violence. We have to stand together. Be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.This fundamentally American ideaâ€”that we're stronger togetherâ€”is why I'm so confident that we can overcome the threats we face, solve our challenges at home, and build a future where no one's left out or left behind.

They deserve a president who understands that when we invest in our children's education, we're investing in all of our futures.Young people across America struggling under the weight of student debt find it difficult to imagine the futures they want, and they deserve a president who will help relieve that burden and help future generations go to college without borrowing a dime for tuition.Grandparents who worry about retirement deserve a president who will protect and expand Social Security for those who need it most, not cut or privatize it.Families deserve a president who will fight for the things that are priorities at home but too often aren't priorities in Washington: affordable child care, paid leave, and something we've waited for long enoughâ€”equal pay for equal work.Above all, hard-working Americans across our country deserve a president with both the ideas and the know-how to create good jobs with rising incomes right here in our country. And I am absolutely convinced that we have the tools to do that.",,status,,3/15/16 21:21,28267,1655,1950,25450,2584,51,20,7,155,2016-03-15

Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear for one reason: to get votes. He's encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes.Donald Trump says he wants to round up millions of Latino immigrants and kick them out of the United Statesâ€”a nation built by immigrants. He wants to ban all Muslims from the United Statesâ€”a country founded on religious freedom. He supports torture, advocates killing the wives and children of our enemies, and had to be told that these are war crimes in violation of international law, our own laws, our most deeply held principles, and our Constitution. And after stoking every fire he can think of, Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with himâ€”literally punch them in the faceâ€”and then offers to pay their legal bills. Now, at our best, Americans have rejected demagogues and fear mongers.
